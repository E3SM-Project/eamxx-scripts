\section{Introduction}
% Briefly tell what this doc is about: AD + PBUF

\section{Atm processes}
% Describe what atm processes are, and how the AD interacts with them
% Advantages of abstract interface: flexibility in terms of seq vs parallel,
% as well as reordering of processes; ease to add new parametrizations.
% What does one need to do to add his/her/their new parametrization?

\section{Fields and field repository}
% Describe (without committing too much to the details) the
% data structure we use for fields (header + view), what is in the
% header (name, layout, dims). The field repo will replace the
% current pbuf. Processes will have (at least at setup/init time)
% access to the whole pbuf. Describe ways that we are thinking
% to implement to limit access to pbuf (const-correctness, fields'
% timestamps checks,...).
