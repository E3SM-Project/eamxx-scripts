# scream-docs
==========================
This is where all papers, design documents, etc for the Simple Cloud Resolving
E3SM Atmosphere Model live. This is also where micro-app code and related testing
scripts are put before migrating finished code to the (scream fork of the) E3SM repo.

## Top-level Code structure (as of 1/11/19):
==========================
* design-docs/             Where to put our design docs
* publications/            Where to put publications (journal articles and white papers) we write.

* perf-scripts/: 	         Stuff for making performance plots
* micro-apps/:   	         Contains code for each micro-app we've generated
